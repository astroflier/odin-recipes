    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, season pork with salt and pepper. In a large pot over
        medium heat, combine pork, onion, garlic, broth, cloves, cumin seeds,
        and bay leaf. Add enough water to cover pork by 2". Bring to a boil,
        then cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and bring to a simmer. Cook,
        skimming foam off top as needed, 1 hour 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, in a medium heatproof bowl, soak chiles in 2 cups boiling
        water for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer chiles and about 1/2 cup soaking liquid to a blender. Blend
        until smooth, adding more water as needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add chile puree and hominy to pot with pork. Cover and continue to
        simmer, stirring occasionally, until pork is very tender, about 1 hour
        30 minutes more; season with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>Top pozole with radishes, cabbage, and cilantro.</li>
