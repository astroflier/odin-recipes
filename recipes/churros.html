    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make churros: In a large saucepan over medium heat, add water, butter,
        and sugar. Bring to a boil, then add vanilla. Turn off heat and add
        flour and salt. Stir with a wooden spoon until thickened, 30 seconds.
        Let mixture cool for 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        To cooled mixture, using a hand mixer, beat in eggs one at a time until
        combined. Transfer mixture to a piping bag fitted with a large open star
        tip.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large pot over medium heat, add enough oil to come halfway up the
        sides and heat to 375°. Holding the piping bag a few inches above the
        oil, carefully pipe churros into 6" long ropes. Use kitchen scissors to
        cut off dough from piping bag.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry until golden, 4 to 5 minutes, turning as necessary. Fry 3 to 4
        churros at a time and let oil come back to 375° before each batch.
        Remove churros with a slotted spoon or tongs and immediately roll
        churros in cinnamon sugar, then place on a cooling rack.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make chocolate dipping sauce: Place chocolate chips in a medium
        heatproof bowl. In a small saucepan over medium heat, bring heavy cream
        to a simmer. Pour hot cream over chocolate chips and let sit 2 minutes.
        Add cinnamon and salt and whisk to combine.
      </li>
      <li>Serve churros with chocolate dipping sauce.</li>

        >It's important to note that the 10 minute cooling time before frying is
        very important. Your batter will stiffen as it cools, allowing it to fry
        better!
